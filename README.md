# Real Estate Price Prediction

Welcome to the Real Estate Price Prediction project! This repository contains a comprehensive solution for predicting house prices using Data Science and Machine Learning techniques. This project is designed to help you understand the art and science behind predicting real estate prices.

## Brief Introduction

Introduction
In this project, I have implemented a Real Estate Price Predictor by leveraging various Data Science and Machine Learning techniques, including:

Feature Engineering: Carefully selecting and transforming relevant features to improve the model's predictive performance.

Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.

One Hot Encoding: Converting categorical variables into numerical format for model compatibility.

Outlier Detection: Identifying and handling outliers that could adversely affect the model's accuracy.

Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the dimensionality of the dataset to improve model training efficiency.

GridSearchCV: Employing hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize model performance.

The project also includes a user-friendly frontend, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where users can input property details and get price predictions.

## Technologies Used
This project is powered by a diverse set of technologies, including:

Python: Used as the primary programming language for data manipulation, model building, and server-side scripting.

Pandas: Utilized for efficient data cleaning and manipulation.

Matplotlib: Employed for data visualization, allowing for insightful analysis of the dataset.

scikit-learn (sklearn): Used for building and training machine learning models.

Flask: Used as the backend server framework to handle user requests and serve predictions.

HTML, CSS & JS: These web technologies are used to create an intuitive and interactive user interface.
